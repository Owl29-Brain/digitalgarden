# On a large scale model (building), when applying a brick material to the faces there are a very few number of bricks even with the scale turned all the way down. How can a realistic brick look for the building be achieved?

Create a custom texture with a smaller pattern and place it in the textures folder located atÂ 
`SOLIDWORKS Corp Installation folder\SOLIDWORKS\data\images\textures\wall. 
Apply the new Texture.

For this example take the stretchr.jpg image and tile it four times at a resolution of 1200 x 1200. Resize the image to 600 x 600 and a new image with smaller scale will be created. Place the new file in the textures directory and apply the new texture
