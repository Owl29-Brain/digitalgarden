DraftSight® creates and saves the drawing files in **dwg** file format by default. **DWG** is a binary file format used for storing 2D and 3D design data and metadata. In DraftSight® it’s possible to change file save as format using **Save as type** option in Save as Window.

As you can see in the above image, with DraftSight® application, drawing files can be saved in **.dwg, .dwf, .dxf, .dws** and **.dwt** file formats. D

We all know that the a specific DraftSight version can open and edit any old DraftSight drawing file, but the older version cannot open DWG files created in the latest DWG file format? **For example:** The DWG file created in DraftSight 2015 can be opened by DraftSight 2024; however, if the file is saved in the newer version, it cannot be opened in DraftSight 2015.

Below table will highlight the DraftSight version and their native file format:![](https://blog-assets.solidworks.com/uploads/sites/4/Table-3.png)

Now, it is possible to change a newer DWG format to an older file format using the **Save as type** option in the **Save as** Window. It will help to open the DWG file created in the latest DraftSight version in the older DraftSight version.

For example, a **DWG** file created in **DraftSight® 2024** will have the **R2018** file format by default. This file cannot be opened in **DraftSight® 2015**.  Hence, to open the file in DraftSight® 2015, you need to change the DWG file format from **R2018** to **R2015.**
