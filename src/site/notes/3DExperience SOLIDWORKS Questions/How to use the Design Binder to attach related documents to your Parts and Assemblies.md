Did you know that you can attach related documents to your SOLIDWORKS model all in one file?

Yes, that is true. Microsoft Word or PDF files can be attached to Design Binder folder which appears in the FeatureManager design tree. This folder allows you to include documents with related notes to both part and assembly files. The following image shows where the Design Binder can be found and the default embedded file included in the binder:

### What if the SOLIDWORKS design binder folder is missing?

If the SOLIDWORKS Design Binder is not shown in the FeatureManager design tree, you can display it from **Tools** > **Options** > **System Options** > **FeatureManager** > **Design Binder**. The Design Binder is set to appear in the FeatureManager Tree by default, however, if is hidden, select “Show” on drop-down to ensure the folder is visible at all times.
