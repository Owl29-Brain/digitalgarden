# Why customized textures appear blurred into final render?


In general, it depends on the quality and accuracy of the image.  
Other times, it happens that some are good some are blurry, and some blurry seem to perform better in different viewing orientations, however, it could depend on how the image is mapped to the face or the body.

It is suggested to check the following rendering data:

1) Open the part with the texture  
2) In **Display Manager > Decal**, edit the texture.  
3) In **Advanced - Mapping** choose "**Label** instead of **Projection** mode.  
4) Adjust the size and orientation.
